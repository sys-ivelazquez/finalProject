# Grades Dashboard

## NOTE
The dataset was taken from an production environment, that's the reason the students code was changed for a consecutive number, except a friedn of mine code (216557099) that agreed to use his code in this project and my code (219749967), these two codes weren't changed to test the dashboard with that.

This is an interactive dashboard created with Dash and Plotly that allows users to visualize, analyze, and generate metrics from a dataset of student grades. Through a set of filters and graphs, users can gain detailed insights into student grades, as well as visualizations that facilitate data analysis.

## Features

    - Select the academic term.

    - Select the subject (dynamically updated based on the selected term).
